This directory contains a sample input file (input.txt) and three
example output files.  In this example, VSP behaves differently for
each of the three algorithms.

File       Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------
first.out  VSP first-fit with memory size = 2000
best.out   VSP best-fit with memory size = 2000
worst.out  VSP worst-fit with memory size = 2000
